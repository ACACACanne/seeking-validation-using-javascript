# Form Validation with Dynamic Feedback

This project is a simple HTML form enhanced with JavaScript validation and visual feedback. It collects a user's first name, surname, and UK postcode, and validates the input before submission.

Features:
- HTML5 form with required fields
- JavaScript validation for:
  - Minimum character length (3+)
  - UK postcode format using regex
- Alerts for invalid input
- Image swap on successful validation
- External script loading with `defer` for DOM-safe execution

How to use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Fill out the form and click "Submit".
4. If all fields are valid, the image changes to a success graphic.

Future Enhances:
- Replace `alert()` with inline error messages for better accessibility
- Add styling with Tailwind CSS or custom styles
- Expand validation to support additional postcode formats
